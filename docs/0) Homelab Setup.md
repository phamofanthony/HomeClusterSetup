# Overview
I have 3 mini HP elite PC's and am building a home lab cluster based around them to learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes. 

I also have a UGreen DXP 4800 Plus NAS with 48 TB of storage that I plan to connect to it to learn about connecting storage. 

The PC's and NAS are connected to a 5-port gigabit switch which is connected to one of my apartment's ethernet ports.
